      Hi #{@lead.contact_firstname},

  %tr
    %td{height: 24}

  %tr
    %td.typography
      I've tried to reach you a few times to go over the flight options that I had recently emailed over but haven't heard back which tells me one of three things:

  %tr
    %td{height: 24}

  %tr
    %td.typography
      1) You're all set and I should stop bothering you.

  %tr
    %td.typography
      2) You're still interested but haven't had the time to get back to me yet.

  %tr
    %td.typography
      3) You've fallen and can't get up and in that case let me know and I'll call someone to help you.

  %tr
    %td{height: 24}

  %tr
    %td.typography
      Please let me know which one as I'm starting to worry!
