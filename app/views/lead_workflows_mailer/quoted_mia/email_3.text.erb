Hi <%= @lead.contact_firstname %>,

I've tried to reach you a few times to go over the flight options that I had recently emailed over but haven't heard back which tells me one of three things:

1) You're all set and I should stop bothering you.
2) You're still interested but haven't had the time to get back to me yet.
3) You've fallen and can't get up and in that case let me know and I'll call someone to help you.

Please let me know which one as I'm starting to worry!
